# Variables are great and particularly great in Makefiles.
#
# They can be used for default values (e.g. `PYTHON_VERSION`) as well as vars that must be supplied such as
# `JOB_NUMBER` and `GIT_SHA` that we would rely on on being supplied as environment variables from our
# build system.

# Run this or the `jenkins-build` target before running the container.
#
# There is no real reason (in this project) why the Dockerfile exists in a lower 
# level directory. This *is* done when you have a project that needs multiple Dockerfile's 
# and you can use the `-f` argument to indicate where the Dockerfile is.
#
# Note that you can also change the default location of the build context but this is usually 
# the directory that you are running in.

# usage: `make build VERSION=1.0`

# Emulate the passing in build arguments to the `build` target, like would be done in Jenkins or other CI system.
# This has the often desired effect of forcing the image to re-build and ignored cached layers like the upgrading
# and installing of system packages.

# usage: `make jenkins-build JOB_NUMBER=156 GIT_SHA=4j9nq24 VERSION=1.0`
